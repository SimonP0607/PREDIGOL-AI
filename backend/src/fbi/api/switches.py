"""The switches that decide what a reader is shown (plan UX, A9): one rule for all of them.

``FBI_FORECAST_USERS``, ``FBI_CALENDAR_USERS``, ``FBI_KNOWLEDGE_USERS`` and ``FBI_READING_USERS`` are ON when the line is
absent - the owner approved showing PrediGol's forecast, the calendar, the base of the post-match and the structured reading
with phase A9 - and a line in ``/etc/predigol/app.env`` turns any of them off again without a deploy (``=0`` and the API
recreated). A value that reads as neither on nor off counts as off: when the owner wrote something to that line, showing less
is the safer reading of it. The Admin Console's preview never depends on them.
